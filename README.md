# Guess the actors

Welcome to the Celebrity Movie Game!
The Celebrity Name Game is a game that consists of matching the right actors to the movie they were in.
A user will come to the website and enter a movie title of their choosing. Once theyâ€™ve entered a movie title, five names of actors from that movie should appear on the page. Except only 3 of these actors were actually in the movie - the other two are wrong!
After the user guesses the three actors they think were in the film, there is scoring mechanism so they can see how they did!
